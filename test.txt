## Part 1 ##

Design a database to store the below sample dataset.

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alice",
    "city": "Dublin",
    "friends": [1]
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Bob",
    "city": "Dublin",
    "friends": [1, 3, 4, 5]
},
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Charlie",
    "city": "London",
    "friends": [1, 2]
},
{
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Davina",
    "city": "Belfast",
    "friends": [2]
},
{
    "id": 5,
    "name": "John",
    "city": "Galway",
    "friends": [3, 4]
}
```


## Part 2 ##

Using the database from above, write an application that extracts the following:

  1. A user's friend list.
  2. A user's suggested friend list (friend of a friend).
  3. A user's suggested friend list sorted by geography.

Aim to handle datasets reaching into the thousands with high performance and with the smallest possible memory footprint. Please provide unit tests.

  * Name
